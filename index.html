    <p>
        You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign <br>
        accent you met yesterday evening?<br>
<br>
        Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.<br>
<br>
        These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:<br>
<br>
        hello - english<br>
        ciao - italian<br>
        salut - french<br>
        hallo - german<br>
        hola - spanish<br>
        ahoj - czech republic<br>
        czesc - polish<br>
        Notes<br>
<br>
        you can assume the input is a string.<br>
        to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word (Hallowen can pass the test)<br>
        function should be case insensitive to pass the tests<br>
